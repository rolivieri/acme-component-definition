# sc-7.5 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Deny by Default — Allow by Exception

## Control Statement

Deny network communications traffic by default and allow network communications traffic by exception {{ insert: param, sc-07.05_odp.01 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SC-07(05)[01]\] network communications traffic is denied by default {{ insert: param, sc-07.05_odp.01 }};

- \[SC-07(05)[02]\] network communications traffic is allowed by exception {{ insert: param, sc-07.05_odp.01 }}.

## Control guidance

Denying by default and allowing by exception applies to inbound and outbound network communications traffic. A deny-all, permit-by-exception network communications traffic policy ensures that only those system connections that are essential and approved are allowed. Deny by default, allow by exception also applies to a system that is connected to an external system.
