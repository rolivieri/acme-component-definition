# sc-28.1 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Cryptographic Protection

## Control Statement

Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of the following information at rest on {{ insert: param, sc-28.01_odp.02 }}: {{ insert: param, sc-28.01_odp.01 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SC-28(01)[01]\] cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to prevent unauthorized disclosure of {{ insert: param, sc-28.01_odp.01 }} at rest on {{ insert: param, sc-28.01_odp.02 }};

- \[SC-28(01)[02]\] cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to prevent unauthorized modification of {{ insert: param, sc-28.01_odp.01 }} at rest on {{ insert: param, sc-28.01_odp.02 }}.

## Control guidance

The selection of cryptographic mechanisms is based on the need to protect the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information. The strength of mechanism is commensurate with the security category or classification of the information. Organizations have the flexibility to encrypt information on system components or media or encrypt data structures, including files, records, or fields.
